### 🤝 4. CONTRIBUTING.md — How People Can Help

# 🤝 Contributing to Symbiont

Thank you for wanting to help build something radically open and truly global.

## 🛠️ Who We're Looking For

- Developers (frontend, backend, data science, GIS)
- Researchers (climate, food systems, geopolitics)
- Writers and editors (to keep documentation clear)
- Translators (to make this accessible everywhere)
- Community builders (moderators, social outreach)
- Ethical hackers (to test transparency + resilience)

## 🧠 How to Start

1. Read the [`VISION.md`](./VISION.md)
2. Check out current tasks/issues
3. Join the discussion: [link to come — Discord/GitHub Discussions/Matrix]

## 🧼 Ground Rules

- No hate, bigotry, nationalism, or climate denial
- Be generous, be honest, be helpful
- Respect each other’s time and limits
- This is a **public good**, not a startup

## 🧩 Not a coder?

Amazing. You can:
- Help test designs
- Suggest visual metaphors
- Curate data sources
- Translate our pages
- Tell stories about why this matters

Exactly — you **nailed the strategy**:

### 🧠 Legal Help You'll Eventually Want

* **International IP law**: Protecting global open-source under conflicting national laws
* **Data privacy law (GDPR, CCPA)**: Even with no personal data, you're near these lines
* **Environmental law**: Particularly with real-time resource tracking
* **Human rights / humanitarian law**: If you're monitoring migration, displacement, war
* **Cyberlaw**: Hosting, API use, and defense against malicious actors

You don’t need it all now — but you *will* want a **Legal + Ethics Working Group** early on. I can help draft a call for collaborators when you're ready.
